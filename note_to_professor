Dear Professor Mohamad Saleh,


I want to apologize for this submsission around my final project. A lot of thing has happened in my life and I had to little to no control in that.
Because of this, I wasn't able to attend class as frequenlty as I wanted to and didn't know that group were a thing or need one for this final project.

When it was made aware to me, I have anxiety to askinf for help and clearing thing up. I know I should have communicate my situation ealrier but I now do regert 
not infoming you about it. Out of all the professor I have been with in the past you are one of the more understanding professor I have the privilage being taught under.
Even if it was a short amount of time. 

I deeply do apologize for any incovneice this may have caused and despiste everything I did try to put my best effor to cmoplete the project on my own and I hope you accept my submssion.

Thank you for your understanding and for your ppatience

Sincerely,
Melvin

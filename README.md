# Travel Request Web Application  
### Group 19 – CS3338 Software Engineering – Final Project  

This project is a simple web-based system designed to replace paper travel request forms used by workplaces such as the Los Angeles Public Defender's Office.  
Employees can submit travel requests, and managers can review, approve, deny, or settle them.  

The application is built using **Python Flask**, **HTML/Jinja2 templates**, and an **SQLite database**.
